# Eniac_AB_testing_project

## Summary 
   To perform the significance test that whether the four version of Eniac's website are statistically significant.

## Languages and Libraries Used
   - Python: for statistical analysis and A/B testing
   - Pandas: for data manipulation and processing
   - SciPy: for statistical hypothesis testing
   - Seaborn: for data visualization

## Key Learnings
A/B testing analysis revealed that Version_C had the highest click-through rate and was statistically significant compared to Versions B and D, but not to Version_A, which had the second-highest rate. Therefore, both Version_C and Version_A can be considered winners.

## Challenges Overcome
- Understanding statistical significance: Conducting hypothesis tests and interpreting p-values correctly.
- Handling post hoc analysis: Ensuring valid comparisons among different versions without inflating Type I error.

## Additional Considerationsâ€¨
If a definitive winner is required, further steps should be taken:
Consider other metrics alongside click-through rate.
